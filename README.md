# Eventine_Calendine

A calendar is a chart that displays the days, weeks, and months of a specific year, as everyone is aware. 

You may also remember significant occasions, including holidays and festivals, with the use of calendars.

Here, the current day and date are visible to users of the dynamic calendar. They may also use the previous and next icons to show the days of the current, past, or next month. 

Hope This Helps :)
